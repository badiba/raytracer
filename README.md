# Introduction

A C++ ray-tracer that is capable of parsing static scenes, and applying several ray-tracing methods to produce photo-realistic images. Here is a very basic example. More complex ones are available in the [web page](https://badiba.github.io/raytracer/).

This repository is newly created. My goal is to refactor my old code which was written a long time ago, while I was a student. Refactoring process is still ongoing. The old repository is available [here](https://github.com/badiba/raytracer-795). Different versions of the Ray Tracer are provided below. Version at the top is the latest. Each version contains:

- Brief explanations of what is being added in that version.
- Resulting images in that version.
- What kind of bugs have been encountered and how did I manage to fix them.
- My personal experiences.
- If applicable, time comparisons of different implementations.
